Brief instructions on how to run your code
Inside the folder type: npm i
To run the code write: node index.js "here your absolute path to the input text file"
example: node index.js /home/juan/code/test/littledata-challenge/littledata-challenge/input/hash-1.txt

Any notes we should bear in mind (e.g. why you made an unusual choice)
I make many changes in the input to have an array with small arrays with x, y but removing everything around using regex. I use matrix(double arrays) pretty standard for this case and

A brief note on what you found hardest about the challenge
to make the pathfinder library work, but it wasn't very difficult once you have the correct data.

A brief note on how you could improve your code further
Making less changes in the arrays, find a way to do it with less operations

Any feedback to us on how to improve either the challenge itself or the
recruitment process so far

Was very good exercise, but it would be interesting to design a pathfinder algorithm even if is not perfect, at least to try. Of course this is more complex and not everybody will be able to do it
