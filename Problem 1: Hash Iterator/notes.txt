The notes.txt file should include:

Brief instructions on how to run your code
Inside the folder type: npm i
To run the code write: node index.js "here your path to the input text file"
example: node index.js /home/juan/code/test/littledata-challenge/littledata-challenge/input/hash-1.txt

Any notes we should bear in mind (e.g. why you made an unusual choice)
I create an object to update the results in the iteration. I think is a good choice but there are many more.

A brief note on what you found hardest about the challenge
the brute force iterator, sometimes you have to figure out what is going on doing so many iterations.

A brief note on how you could improve your code further
I could do even more dynamic, to create different algorithms or different output length etc.

Any feedback to us on how to improve either the challenge itself or the
recruitment process so far

The problem was great, maybe the explanation of the example could be a bit more clear.
